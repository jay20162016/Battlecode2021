# Overview
Battlecode is a real-time strategy game, for which you will write an AI player. Your AI player will need to strategically manage a robot army and control how your robots work together to defeat the enemy team. As a contestant, you will learn to use artificial intelligence, pathfinding, distributed algorithms, and communications to make your player as competitive as possible.

Teams are given the Battlecode software and a specification of the game rules in early January. Throughout the month, you will refine your player, and compete in scrimmages and tournaments against other teams. During these tournaments, the autonomous players are pitted against each other in a dramatic head-to-head fashion. At the end of the month, the Final Tournament is played out in front of a live audience at MIT, with the top teams receiving cash prizes. The total prize pool is over $15,000.

## Units

Robots in Battlecode move and fight. Miners and landscapers move on the ground, so they can only move to adjacent tiles of similar height. Drones fly, so they can quickly traverse treacherous terrain. If a robot moves into water (or its location gets flooded), it dies. The robots for Battlecode 2020 were:
